The logic is simple: thieves can't steal what they can't see. With Mah Bim, you can disappear in less than 2 seconds. 
Common security systems we know have a clear limitation: they can't prevent theft. 
They only help you know when you're losing your valuable assets! 
The Mah Bim security fogging device, also known as smoke alarm security system, security fogger, jewelry store alarm, smoke alarm, and security smoke device, creates dense and breathable fog in seconds, blocking the view of intruders. 
It can not only prevent armed robbery but also save your life and property, or automatically protect the premises in your absence. Mah Bim is a comprehensive system, and you can use it without the need for old-fashioned alarms.
